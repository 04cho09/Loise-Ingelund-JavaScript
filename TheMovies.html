              <h2>American Psycho</h2>
              <h4>Directed by: Marry Harron</h4>

              <p>
                The movie, American psycho follows Patrick Bateman, an
                investment banker in New York. He battles with his alternate
                psychopathic ego/identity which hinders him from fitting into
                the world of the New York elite. During the duration of the
                movie, we see Bateman and his violent and hedonistic fantasies
                as he spirals more into his urges and psychopathy.

              <h4>Rating and why</h4>

              <p>
                I would personally not give this movie a 5-star rating as the
                movie simply does not have a typical structure, whilst it's not
                bad it was just hard for me to follow it. But the movie is
                supposed to be confusing as Bateman could be perceived as an
                unreliable narrator, but it is just was not my style. Since I
                still give it a 4,5 out of 5, means that I did enjoy it
                greatly, I'm just not a fan of it's "open ending" meaning movies
                where the ending isn't much of an ending since it's up to the
                person watching to imagin what happens next with the set up the
                movie gives you. But as I've mentioned, I am a big fan of gore
                and more specifically blood, which this movie features a lot.

            <h2>The cabin in the woods</h2>
            <h4>Directed by: Drew Goddard</h4>

            <p>
              The cabin in the woods follows a group of five people, it follows
              the structure and premise of a classic slasher film as the group
              of friend were staying in a cabin in the middle of the woods,
              alone. The group has a stereotypical slasher movie set up with
              more specifically an athlete, the innocent one, the smart one, the
              whore and the stoner.

            <h4>Rating and why</h4>
            <p>
              I particularly liked this movie because of how stereotypical it
              was. It started as kind of dumb and carefree. But later dives into
              darker themes, with quite gruesome visuals that I enjoyed. I also
              really liked the structure of the movie as it was very simple and
              easy to follow. The movie itself does not have any hidden or
              deeper themes as other movies I'm featuring but I is still one of
              my favorite horror movies, which is why I rated it a 5 out of 5.

              The movie is a found footage movie following the exploration of
              the catacombs of Paris. The group of subbterranean explorers
              journy is nowhere simple as the catacoumbs strike them with
              nightmares and demons from the past.

            <h4>Rating and why</h4>
            <p>
              I found this movie very thrilling to watch given the format of
              found footage and horror. It shows a lot of different horrors and
              fears as the movie goes through the structure of Dante's inferno,
              The nine levels of hell. I enjoyed watching, but the movie also
              contained blood and violence which I am a fan of, which is the
              reason I've given this film a 5 out of 5.
