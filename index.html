      <h3>Movies I like and why I like them</h3>
      <p>
        I've always been a big fan of horror movies, more gore the better. I
        really enjoy movies i do not have to think much about when watching, but
        that does not mean that i don't like movies that makes me think i simply
        don't have to analys every scene and ditail looking for a deeper meaning
        to like a movie. I don't just like horror movies however, i really enjoy
        the genre "feel good" or fantasy in anime movies, specificly ones by
        Studio Ghibli due to the animation and the calm aura most of the movies
        give out. please check out the link "movies" to read about my all time
        favorit movies in more detail!

      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>
        For the people that don't know me, my full namn is Loise Chonthicha
        Ingelund. I am Thai on my mother side and I was also born there which is
        where my preferense for horror movies started. It started with me simply
        watching corny thai horror comedys with my cusins, which would always
        scare us alot given that we were quite young.
